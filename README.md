# vcf_flanking_sequence_finder

The program extracts several columns ('Chromosome ID', 'Position', 'REF_SNP', 'ALT_SNP', 'is_snp') from a .vcf file (Variant Call Format). It parses a genomic fasta file, searches for SNPs from the .vcf and returns each SNP with its flanking sequences (50 nucleotides on each side).

It is run from the command line, it informs the user how much memory is needed to save the results and if that memory is available or not.

[A VCF file][1] is a text file used in bioinformatics to store information about variant genetic sequences. It contains metadata that describes the file's format, source, created on date, and reference genome, and it contains column-formatted genetic sequencing data. VCF files are used as part of large-scale genotyping and DNA sequencing projects, such as the 1000 Genomes Project.

To streamline the storage of variant genetic information, the 1000 Genomes Project created the Variant Call Format (VCF). This format allows bioinformaticians to catalog variants of a genome without recording those variants' genetic data in their entirety. Instead, bioinformaticians save one default reference copy of the genome in a .FASTA or another file, and then they describe the genome's variants in a VCF file. This allows bioinformaticians to quickly review and analyze genetic variants, without sifting through redundant data.

(include/remove this?)
In its header, the VCF file describes its own file format, created on date, source, and other relevant metadata. The most important piece of metadata is the VCF file's ##reference, which describes where the VCF file's reference genome is stored.

In its body, the VCF file contains variant genetic sequencing data that is separated into eight mandatory columns, including:

    CHROM: The name of the sequence on which the variation is being called
    POS: The 1-based position of the variation on the given sequence
    ID: The identifier of the variation or . if the identifier is unknown
    REF: The reference base at the given position on the reference sequence
    ALT: This list of alternative alleles at this position
    QUAL: A quality score associated with the inference of the given alleles
    FILTER: A flag indicating which of a given set of filters the variation has passed
    INFO: An extensible list of key-value pairs describing the variation

Some VCF files may contain additional columns of data, including FORMAT and SAMPLE.

# Project Title

## Description
    What your application does,
    Why you used the technologies you used,
    Some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future.

***

## Add a Table of Contents (Optional)

***

## How to Install Your Project
If your project is software or an app that needs installation, you should include the steps required to install your project. Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

***

## How to Use Your Project
Provide instructions and examples so users/contributors can use the project. This will make it easy for them in case they encounter a problem â€“ they will always have a place of reference.
You can also include screenshots to show examples of the running project.

***

## Include Credits
If you worked on the project as a team or an organization, list your collaborators/team members. You should also include links to their GitHub profiles.
Also, if you followed tutorials to build that particular project, include links to those here as well. This is just a way to show your appreciation and also to help others get a first hand copy of the project.

***

## List the License
This is the last section of most README. It lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, use https://choosealicense.com/

### THAT'S THE BASICS, NOW SOME GOOD EXTRAS:

## Badges (below the Title? or the Description?)

## How to Contribute to the Project
If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it (an open source project), you will want to add guidelines to let them know on how they can contribute to your project.
The Contributor Covenant and The Contributing guide will give you the help you need when setting up the rules.

## Include Tests
Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide code examples and how to run them.
